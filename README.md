# GCIS_MDE_methodology

This repository contains the files developed in the paper "Microservice-based applications methodology".

## Repository structure

In this section the structure of this repository will be shown. The main folders are the following:

- [IDE_platform](https://github.com/ekhurtado/GCIS_MDE_methodology/tree/main/IDE_platform): This folder includes all the files of the IDE platform that this work proposes. Precisely the Node-RED platform has been selected for this responsibility.
- [Components](https://github.com/ekhurtado/GCIS_MDE_methodology/tree/main/Components): In this folder all the files related to the components are stored. 
- [Orchestration platform](https://github.com/ekhurtado/GCIS_MDE_methodology/tree/main/Orchestration_platform): This folder stores the resources of the container orchestration platform for the delivery and operation of microservide-based applications. The platform selected in this project has been Kubernetes.
- [Meta-models](https://github.com/ekhurtado/GCIS_MDE_methodology/tree/main/Meta_models): The meta-models proposed in this paper are presented in this folder.

It should be noted that each of them has a file _README_ with instructions and resources for using the technologies.
